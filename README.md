# Coronary-heart-disease-risk-prediction--SVM-project
**Framingham Heartdisease Dataset Analysis**- This repository contains the analysis of the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The study aims to identify the factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to predict the likelihood of CVD using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**Dataset** - The  dataset includes various features related to demographics, lifestyle, and medical history of participants. It is used to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. And the dataset is taken form kaggle.

**Data Usage** Using Google colab the data were processed as: data preprocessing and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, Training SVM model, model training and prediction of results through confussion matrix and classification report.
  
**Results**- Coronary heart disease risk were predicted evaluationg all CVD risk factor using SVM mode and evaluated the model performance.
